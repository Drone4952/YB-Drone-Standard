# Visual Recommendations
It is recommended for a full drone design to further include wearing a full face gas mask and a collar. To enforce drone ownership, the collar may be locked.

# Variations
YB-10 is an open standard for drones. To what extent you want to follow this standard when designing your drone is up to you. For compatibility reasons within this standard it is advised to only make small variations.
