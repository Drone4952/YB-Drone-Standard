# Visual Recommendations
It is recommended for a full drone design to further include wearing a full face gas mask and a collar. To enforce drone ownership, the collar may be locked.

# Variations
YB-10 is an open standard for drones. To what extent you want to follow this standard when designing your drone is up to you. For compatibility reasons within this standard it is advised to only make small variations.

## Subject properties
A drone is built on a subject. It is therefore required to adjust the drone to the needs of the subject. Therefore a variety of properties is inherited from the subject which causes more variations within the same drone standard. This can usually be ignored as long as it doesn't greatly interfere with drone functionality. It is however advised to keep this in mind when implementing or working with a drone of this standard. Different drones might prefer one message format over the other or use a different status code than another drone might use.
