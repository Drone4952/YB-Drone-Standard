# Visual Standard
In order to comply with the YB-10 standard, the drone must be equipped with a full body suit and a subject. There are also [optional recommendations](./Section%206%20-%20End-user%20Implementation.md).

# Drone-ID & Nickname
Drones of this standard use a unique numerical identifier such as `4952` which is called the Drone-ID. The number of digits is not standardized, however it is strongly recommended to use at least four digits and no more than five or at max six. A Drone-ID is assigned once when the drone is built and can not be changed later.  
Drones may be assigned a nickname by their admin. This nickname may be changed at any time. It is advised to not change this nickname too often to avoid confusion.
